# 👋 Greetings. I am @bhekumuzitshuma

- 👀 I’m interested in **Backend Development, System Architecture, Networking & System Administration, and Cybersecurity**—because making things scalable, secure, and borderline unhackable is what separates the engineers from the script kiddies.
- 🌱 Currently mastering **DevOps and Cybersecurity**—because someone has to keep the lights on while others introduce vulnerabilities.
- 💾 Automating everything. If I have to do it twice, it’s getting scripted.
- 🛑 Not a fan of inefficiency, bad code, or unnecessary meetings.
- 💞️ Open to collaborating on anything within my expertise—just don't ask me to build your startup for "exposure."

> "I prefer to live my life like it’s an RPG. Every task I do earns me XP."
